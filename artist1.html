        <h3>Review of Sour</h3>
        <p>Just as “Deja Vu” and “Good 4 U” proved Rodrigo was going to be much more than a one-and-done phenom with a viral hit about careening through heartbreak, Sour confirms this is just the start of her story, where she expertly rides the wave of teenage turbulence and emotional chaos down any road she chooses.

        <h3>Review of Sour</h3>
        <p id="oliviaReview">While, in its lyricism, Sour is still figuring out formulas, its sound is an achievement, a smart juxtaposition of a decade of developments in and adjacent to popular music. Working with co-writer and producer Dan Nigro — former front man of Long Island’s As Tall As Lions, whose 2006 self-titled debut folded disparate genres into moody art rock to the delight of the Alternative Press and AbsolutePunk set — Olivia tries on the punk-pop of YUNGBLUD, the pop-rock singularity of Sucker-era Charli XCX, the ASMR elegance of Lorde and Billie Eilish, and the folk-pop balladry of early Taylor Swift, mirroring the post-genre melange of solo Hayley Williams and Caroline Polachek as often as the young star is willing to ditch the drippy folk. When Sour’s sense for what zoomers are going through syncs with a knowledge of what they’re listening to, it feels visionary. But while there isn’t a bad song in the batch, by the time you get to “Favorite Crime” and “Happier,” it feels like we hit the bottom of the singer’s well of potent relationship observations. She’s young, and she’s got some living to do; she’s writing what she knows and processing her trauma with a maturity beyond her years. And what makes the album grate a little also rings true to the feeling of being on the mend after a split. You replay scenes in your head. You dissect how you behaved, what red flags you should’ve minded. Sour is a great start. Eventually, Olivia Rodrigo will be back, and she’ll be better.
